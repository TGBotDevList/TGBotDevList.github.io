# Do you offer any contract templates?

No. Doing that would imply that I understand their limitations and culprits, which I don't. Maybe the developer of your choice has a template on their own.

# The client won't pay. Can you help?

No.

# The developer won't deliver. Can you help?

No.

# I've contacted a developer and they didn't respond. Are they still active?

I probably don't know. I only take down developer profiles if their GitHub profile is deleted. In this case, please contact me via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TGBotDevList/tgbotdevlist.github.io/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.

# Can I update my contact info?

Sure. Just open a new pull request.

# Which Jekyll template does this page use?

[Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

# How many Möbius strips can you fit in a three dimensional space?

This may come as a surprise, but you can only fit countably many Möbius strips in a three dimensional space, even though Möbius strips are two dimensional objects. For all the juice details, head [here](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218216518420051).
